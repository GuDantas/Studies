# Studies
A repository for my learning content
My first git repository too 
I got 17 years old
And I used to play with code since my 13 years
Nowadays I live in São Paulo Brazil, the biggiest city in South America
The main purpose of this GitHub is to show the evolution of my code and logic
I´m mainly focused on CSharp
But i have a account on the Hackerrank to improve my logic with python
My nickname in the Hackerrank is the same as the GitHub, GuDantas
