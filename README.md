A repository for my learning content
My first git repository too 
I'm 17 years old
And I used to play with code since my 13 years
Nowadays I live in São Paulo Brazil, the biggiest city in South America
The main purpose of this GitHub is to show the evolution of my code and logic
I´m mainly focused on CSharp
But i have a account on the Hackerrank to improve my logic with python
My nickname in the Hackerrank is the same as the GitHub, GuDantas
I'm doing a little course on live before my college, and I'm going to leave all the content learned here too
I'm work actually as a infrastructure technician
I'm almost two years on this work and already learned a lot
I'm at this job for experience mainly
But i'm want to be a developer, and this job isn't focused on developing anything
Infraestructure is their focus, but not mine
But I'm still taking advantage off the knowledge that I see daily
